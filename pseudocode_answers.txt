###Short Answer	

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

> To give a syntaxless description of the logic and data flow. This allows programmers of different syntax to then port off into whatever language they prefer. Pseudocode provides a universal language any programmer could interpret.  

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

> You would get an error because its not in any specific language syntax


### Programming Assigment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
    
```
INPUT first_num
INPUT second_num
IF first_num is greater than second_num
	PRINT "First number is greater"
ELSE
	PRINT "Second number is greater"
END IF
```

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

```
INIT number to 0

while the number is not 100
	PRINT number
	ADD 1 to number
END WHILE
```    

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

```
INPUT phoneBook
INPUT phoneBookMaster
INIT foundPhone
REPEAT
	foundPhone = true
	return foundPhone
UNTIL phoneBookmaster = phoneBook
```

4  Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

```
var first-num, second_num

if (first_num > second_num){

	console.log("First number is greater");
else{
	console.log("Second number is greater");
```
