In this article, it mainly compares Vue vs React, but it mentions why it doesn't compare Angular. Angular isn't backwards compatible, so older apps aren't able to use the new updates from Angular v2- v6. Vue is a newer framework, and has the ability to cherrypick the good and bad of Angular and React, making it a progressive framework. Talking with my mentor and in this article, Angular is becoming obselete. If Angular isnt backwards compatible, and you have to rebuild you app because of it, why not use the new hot framework that has all the new framework features to make your life easier? I think this is the biggest pro and con of Angular vs Vue. Angular is old, but with some opportunities for a few more years, and Vue is new but with more opportunities rapidly growing. As a web developer, that seems to be the most important along with Vue having the best features from Angular and React, easy to use, and ability to scale. Anuglar seems to be a bigger learning curve, along with it being overkill on smaller projects.
