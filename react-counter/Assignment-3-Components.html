####Questions


> Peruse the Official React documentation by Facebook, note down anything interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

A: I think its interesting how React keeps code organized with components. I discussed this with my mentor, and we also talked about the benefits of React and its future.   


> Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience building the component from scratch with your mentor.
