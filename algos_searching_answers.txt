###Questions


>1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: At a horsetrack, if you wanted to know the order a horse finished, you'd start at first place and work your way back.

>2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: At a bowling alley, if I didn't know where my lanes was, and they were numbered. I could go to the middle aisle, and the lane would be on one side, so I wouldn't have to look on one side of the alley.

>3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7 times

>4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3 times

>5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear because binary doesn't work well with unsorted collections

>6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, 
which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary because it searches faster thru sorted collections. Every single item wouldn't have to be checked

###Programs

>1.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

```
var names = ["Albatross", "Baboon", "Cat", "Dog", "Falcon", "Killer Whale"];

function WordSearch(arr, word){ 
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);
    
    if(arr[mid] > word) { 
      high = arr[mid -1];
    } 
    else if (arr[mid] < word) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    }
    else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "That name is not in the list";
}

console.log(WordSearch(names, "Albatross"));
```

>2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A: 

```
var fishTank = ["goldfish", "goldfish", "green swordtail", 
			"commmon molly", "goldfish", "platy", "white-spotted goldfish"];

function NetFish(arr, target){
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === target){
      return "You've net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank";
    }
  }
  return "The he only white-spotted goldfish isn't in the tank .";
}

console.log(NetFish(fishTank, "white-spotted goldfish"));
```
