###Questions

>1.Define and compare recursion and iteration.

A: Recursion is when a function repeatedly calls itself, moving towards the base case, and Iteration is repeating a set of instructions.

>2.Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion.
   
A: Fibonacci, factorial, merge sort, quick sort, binary tree

>3.When should you use recursion, and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples for each.
   
A: Recursion should be used when an algorithm is defined as a combination of sub-problems. Calculating a factorial is an example. You should avoid recursion when going straight through a data set. An example would be maximum value of an array.

>4.Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algorithms from the checkpoint (factorial, maximum, and fibonacci). What is similar, and what is different?
    
A: Both are logged. Difference is how the alogrithm gets to the result. One solution may look simpler than another. Iterating to find the maximum looks simpler than using recursion, but using iteration on a factorial looks more complicated

>5.Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.
    
```
var arrayOfArrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7, [8, 9],[[10, 11, 12],[13, 14, 15], 16]]];
var count = 0;

function countArrayItems(arr){
  if(!Array.isArray(arr)){
     count++;
  } else {
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      countArrayItems(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return count;
}

console.log(countArrayItems(arrayOfArrays));
```

>6.A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same either direction (e.g., racecar). Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.
   
```
function CheckPalindrom(word){
  if (word.length <= 1) {
    return true;
  }
  else if (word[0] === word[word.length -1]) {
    return CheckPalindrom(word.slice(1, word.length -1) );
  }
  return false;
};

console.log(CheckPalindrom("racecar"));
console.log(CheckPalindrom("bloc!"));
console.log(CheckPalindrom("madam"));
```

 Google Easter Egg: Google the term "recursion". Google will prompt you with "Did you mean: recursion". Explain why this behavior exhibits properties of recursion.
