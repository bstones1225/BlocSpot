###Questions

>1.Run the commands `sort`, `wc` and `uniq` on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

A: `sort` sorts the actual code line by line. 'wc' gives newline, word, and byte counts for a file. `uniq` sorts but doesnt print duplicate lines.

>2.Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

A: `sort commands.js | cat` has the contents sorted and then printed. `cat commands.js | sort` prints the contents, then sorts. `uniq commands.js | cat` removes the duplicates then prints the content of the file.

>3.Implement the `head command` in the commands.js file. The `head` command outputs the first n lines of a file (you may decide what n is). This function will be similar to cat in structure so it will be helpful to reference.
